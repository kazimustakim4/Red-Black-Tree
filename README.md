# Red-Black-Tree
We learned that binary trees are graphs which don’t have cycles. Additionally, they follow another set of rules, namely that there is a node known as a root, it generally has a left and right child but no more than 2 children (0 is possible) and each of those children can have a left and right child. The binary search trees we made in this course have the following rules for children:

The left child is strictly less than the value of the parent node.
The right child is greater than or equal to the parent node.
 

With that in mind, program a binary search tree in Java which follows the above rules and doesn’t allow any nodes with values greater than 100 or less than -50 on it (including the root). Entering other values will cause an error.
Depending on if your EMPLID is even or odd do the following:
If your EMPLID is even, program an AVL tree in any language you’d like.
If your EMPLID is odd, program a red-black tree in any language you’d like.
